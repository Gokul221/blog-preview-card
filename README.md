## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

Though I'm satisfied with the solution, there could be improvements on removing the redundant CSS styles and refined syntax structure. I was able to manage to make the site responsive over multiple screens by using multiple breakpoints but it could be handled in a more mature way I think. I would be certainly improving these things in future projects.
